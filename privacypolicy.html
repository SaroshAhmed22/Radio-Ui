            <b class="font-weight-bold">Information we collect from you automatically</b>
            <br><br>
            We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and
            usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device,
            including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving our site and service. We
            collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated
            to identify any particular individual user.

            <br><br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Device identifiers</b> <br><br>
            When you access Hallelujah Gospel by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones
            or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as
            a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures
            stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device
            identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the
            device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Hallelujah Gospel. A device
            identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use our site. A device identifier may
            remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through our site.
            Some features of our site may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired
            or disabled.
            <br><br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Log file information</b> <br> <br>
            Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access
            Hallelujah Gospel. When you use our site, our servers automatically record certain log file information.
            These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”)
            address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on
            the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. <br> <br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Location data</b>
            <br><br>
            When you access Hallelujah Gospel by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or
            remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or
            similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information
            about how you browse and use our site. Some features of our site, particularly location-based services, may
            not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
            <br><br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Where we store your personal data</b> <br> <br>
            The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European
            Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for Hallelujah
            Gospel or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your
            order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your
            personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably
            necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. <br> <br>
            All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be
            encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables
            you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask
            you not to share a password with anyone. <br> <br>
            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will
            do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our
            site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict
            procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
            <br> <br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">

            We will not rent or sell your information into third parties outside Hallelujah Gospel and its group
            companies (including any parent, subsidiaries and affiliates) without your consent, except:
            <br> <br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Who we may share your information with</b>
            <br><br>
            We may share your information with third-party service providers for the purpose of providing service to you
            and to facilitate Hallelujah Gospel’s interests, as outlined above. Those service providers will only be
            provided with access to your information as is reasonably necessary for the purpose that Hallelujah Gospel
            has engaged the service provider, and we will require that such third parties comply with this Privacy
            Policy and any applicable laws.
            <br><br>
            Some of the third parties that Hallelujah Gospel may share your personal information with include providers
            who assist Hallelujah Gospel with functions such as: <br><br>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">

            In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to
            the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
            <br><br>
            If Hallelujah Gospel or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case
            personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
            <br><br>
            We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share
            that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties. <br><br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Who you may choose to share your User Content with</b>
            <br><br>
            Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the site, such as User Content,
            becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. Subject to your profile
            and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other users. If you remove
            information that you posted to the site, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the
            site, or if other users have copied or saved that information. <br> <br>
            Hallelujah Gospel may also share your information with third parties in certain circumstances, such as
            where: <br><br>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
              <li>we are required to do so as a result of a court order, subpoena or other legal requirement;</li><br>
              <li>we believe that it is necessary to protect you or Hallelujah Gospel, such as where we consider that
                there is a need to investigate potentially fraudulent or criminal activity; or</li><br>
              <li>you have consented to our sharing it with a third party for a particular purpose.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Ads on Hallelujah Gospel</b>
            <br><br>
            We may share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data relating to
            your use of our site with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to
            you. Hallelujah Gospel may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the site.
            These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile
            device, the ads and ad links that appear on the site, and will automatically receive your IP address when
            they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, device identifiers, location data, etc.)
            to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the site, and to
            measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Hallelujah Gospel does
            not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with
            these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes. <br> <br>
            Please note that an advertiser may ask Hallelujah Gospel to show an ad to a certain audience of users (e.g.,
            based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, Hallelujah Gospel determines the target
            audience and Hallelujah Gospel serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous
            aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude
            that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
            <br><br>
            The Hallelujah Gospel Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party
            advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers
            for more information.
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Cross-border transfers of information (for users in the EEA)</b> <br><br>
            For Hallelujah Gospel users in the EEA, where we transfer your information to a third party provider that is
            not located in the EEA, and is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we will require
            those third party providers to enter into an agreement that provides appropriate safeguards for your
            information. From time to time we may also seek your consent to transfer your information to a third country
            outside the EEA. <br><br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">
              How we transfer, store and protect your data
            </b>
            Your information collected through the site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other
            country in which Hallelujah Gospel or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities.
            Hallelujah Gospel may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to
            affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other
            countries or jurisdictions around the world. As a result, we may transfer information, including personal
            information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your
            jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which
            Hallelujah Gospel or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the
            use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. <br> <br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Keeping your information safe</b>
            <br><br>
            Hallelujah Gospel cares about the security of your information, and uses appropriate safeguards to preserve
            the integrity and security of all information collected through the site. To protect your privacy and
            security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before
            granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password
            and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Hallelujah Gospel, at
            all times. However, Hallelujah Gospel cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit
            to Hallelujah Gospel or guarantee that information on the site may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
            destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites

            responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party. <br><br>

            can also stop receiving promotional email communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link”
            provided in such communications. We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. You may
            not opt out of Hallelujah Gospel-related communications (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing

            <br><br>
            Please refer to your mobile device or browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and
            disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Depending on your type of device, it may not be
            possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms on your mobile device. Note that disabling cookies and/or
            other tracking tools prevents Hallelujah Gospel or its business partners from tracking your browser’s
            activities in relation to the site, and for use in targeted advertising activities by third parties.
            However, doing so may disable many of the features available through the site. If you have any questions

            <b class="font-weight-bold">Your Rights in respect of your Information</b> <br><br>
            The laws of some countries grant particular rights in respect of personal information. Users in those
            jurisdictions may have the right to:
            <br><br>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
              <li>Request a copy of your information;</li><br>
              <li>Request that we correct inaccuracies relating to your information;</li><br>
              <li>Request that your information be deleted or that we restrict access to it;</li><br>
              <li>Request a structured electronic version of your information; and</li><br>
              <li>Object to our use of your information;</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            In some circumstances Hallelujah Gospel may not be able to comply with a request that you make in respect of
            your personal data. For example, we may not be able to provide a copy of your information where it infringes
            on the rights of another site user. We may also be required to retain certain information that you ask us to
            delete for various reasons, such as where there is a legal requirement to do so. In some cases, you may have
            shared your information with third parties, such as by posting User Content on a third party’s website. In
            that case Hallelujah Gospel will not be able to delete the information, and you will need to contact that
            third party directly. <br> <br>
            If we are unable to resolve your request, or if you are concerned about a potential violation, you may be
            entitled to report the issue or make a complaint to the data protection authority in your jurisdiction.
            <br><br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">Children’s Privacy</b><br><br>
            Hallelujah Gospel does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of
            16. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16 without
            verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe
            that we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us directly at <a
              href="contact.html" class="text-danger">contact-us</a>
            <br><br>
            <b class="font-weight-bold">How long we keep your User Content</b>
            <br><br>
            Following termination or deactivation of your user account, Hallelujah Gospel may retain your profile
            information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time, and for as long as we have a valid purpose
            to do so. In particular, Hallelujah Gospel may retain your information for the purpose of compliance with
            its legal and audit obligations, and for backup and archival purposes.
